          <!-- Biography of Keshi -->
          <p>Casey Luong (born November 4, 1994), known 
            professionally as Keshi (stylized as keshi), is an 
            American singer, songwriter, and record producer.
            Recognized for his distinctive blend of lo-fi 
            hip-hop, R&B, and indie influences, Keshi has 
            garnered a global fanbase with his introspective
            lyrics and atmospheric soundscapes.

            Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Keshi developed
            an early interest in music, teaching himself to play
            guitar at the age of 13. Inspired by artists such as 
            John Mayer and Ed Sheeran, he began writing songs
            during his teenage years, often sharing his music 
            with friends and family. Despite his passion, Keshi 
            initially pursued a career as a registered nurse after 
            graduating from the University of Texas at Austin.

          <!-- Biography of Keshi -->
          <p>While working as a nurse, Keshi turned to music
            as a creative outlet, producing and recording songs 
            in his bedroom studio. He uploaded these tracks to 
            SoundCloud under the name "keshi," a childhood 
            nickname given by his fiancée. His early releases, 
            characterized by lo-fi beats and melancholic vocals,
            quickly gained traction online, earning him a loyal 
            following and recognition within the underground 
            music community.
            
            Keshi’s decision to leave his nursing career to pursue
            music full-time marked a pivotal moment in his life.
            His breakout EPs, including Skeletons (2019) and 
            Band-Aids (2020), showcased his unique sound and 
            cemented his status as a rising artist in the 
            alternative R&B scene.
